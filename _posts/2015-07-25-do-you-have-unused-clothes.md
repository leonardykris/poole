title: Do you have unused clothes?

Last weekend, I posted about
Well, you see, I finished my study and now I'm moving out from my current unit in Bandar Sunway.
My roommate told me to clear my wardrobe first and I did, only to find out that even after clearing up most of my old clothes last year for charity. My rate of clothes collection is almost 1 per event.
I messaged my friend Shenn because I was talking to her about donating the clothes in nearby charities, only to find out that according to her there are many in needs

Then it struck me, wait, how many people are there again in my graduating batch? And what about those from the business school, ACCA or college? If each person has 1 unused clothes, that could simply means there are thousands of unused clothes for every batch. And these clothes will most likely go to the dumpster when there are no takers.
