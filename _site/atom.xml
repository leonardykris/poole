Well, you see, I finished my study and now Iâ€™m moving out from my current unit in Bandar Sunway.
My roommate told me to clear my wardrobe first and I did, only to find out that even after clearing up most of my old clothes last year for charity. My rate of clothes collection is almost 1 per event.
I messaged my friend Shenn because I was talking to her about donating the clothes in nearby charities, only to find out that according to her there are many in needs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it struck me, wait, how many people are there again in my graduating batch? And what about those from the business school, ACCA or college? If each person has 1 unused clothes, that could simply means there are thousands of unused clothes for every batch. And these clothes will most likely go to the dumpster when there are no takers.&lt;/p&gt;
